**Introduction**

This document outlines the progressive development and amendments made to the Customer Agreement (CA) for our software engineering master's project. The application, designed to streamline processes for healthcare companies, has undergone several iterations of the CA, each reflecting advancements in features, compliance adherence, and pricing strategies.

**Version History**

*Customer Agreement v1*: The initial version of the Customer Agreement, laying the foundation for our application's terms of service and user policies.

*Customer Agreement v2*: Revised in accordance with recommendations from Claudette, a compliance and legal standards software. This version ensured enhanced adherence to regulatory and legal norms.

*Customer Agreement v3*: A significant update that fully integrated Claudette's recommendations. A notable change in this version was the shift in the billing model for hospital companies. We transitioned from a per-user fee to a fixed price model based on the type of plan selected. This version also includes the first cost-benefit analysis, leading to the initial pricing strategy.

*Customer Agreement v4*: Introduced an AI Chatbot feature, enhancing user interaction and support. This version required updates to the CA to encompass the terms of using AI technology within the app.

*Customer Agreement v5*: Marked the introduction of a 24-hour telephone support service. The CA was updated to reflect the terms and conditions of this new feature.

*Customer Agreement v6*: This version represents a significant overhaul in pricing. Driven by the introduction of new functionalities and a strategic decision by the company's management, it entailed a comprehensive revision of the pricing structure.

*Customer Agreement v7*: This version changed the pricing feature due to a revision of external api prices.

*Customer Agreement v8*: This version changed the pricing and the service level agreement.

**Pricing Strategy and Cost-Benefit Analysis**

*Initial Pricing (up to CA v3)*: The pricing strategy up to version 3 was driven by the change in billing models as documented in CA v3. The cost-benefit analysis conducted at this stage served as the foundation for our initial pricing framework.

Revised Pricing: Post the introduction of the AI Chatbot and 24-hour phone service, a second cost-benefit analysis was conducted. This analysis led to a new pricing strategy, formulated and decided by the company's management, reflecting the enhanced value proposition of our application. Also taking into account new prices for external API's.

finally, there was a final adjustment in cost-benefits v3.

**Conclusion**

The evolution of the Customer Agreement for our application reflects our commitment to continuous improvement, legal compliance, and customer satisfaction. Each version of the CA not only aligns with the enhancements in the app's features but also ensures that we remain transparent and fair in our dealings with healthcare companies. The pricing strategies, dictated by thorough cost-benefit analyses, ensure competitiveness and sustainability of our business model.

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to the development trajectory of the Customer Agreement, symbolizing our journey towards creating a robust, compliant, and user-friendly software solution in the healthcare industry.
